- conftest.py to fix path; clear shared store keys per-test for count assertions; retire pre-rebuild tests to _archive instead of leaving false-signal broken collection  [relates: member_of]  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_test_suite_hermeticity)

- Wire heuristic assigners into emit at write-time (assign-at-write); when adding a Slice verify the production call path exists, not just unit tests on the class  [relates: member_of]  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_slice5_themeassigner_not_wired)
- Slice 2 complete -- see narrative_slice_2_trackrouter. Next: Slice 7 boot feed.  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_slice_1_beatlog)
- Import isolate_canonical in subprocess CLI tests; never mix beat_log and chronicle stores  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_test_isolation_gap)
- Commit untracked narrative files; next is Slice 7 bi-temporal plus boot feed  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_slices_3_5_built)
- TrackRouter Tier 0 is default; Slice 6 embeddings failed ablation -- do not ship as default  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_slice_2_trackrouter)
- The shared memory system is functional. Experiments are found by their experiment_name or keyword overlap in recommendation text.  (source: learn:experiment:shared_memory_verification)
- Slice 2: TrackRouter (heuristic) + gold fixture + benchmark metrics; ARI 0.86 / WindowDiff 0.15 (bar met); routing wired into emit  (source: git:043d55b24e22)
- Slice 1: BeatLog (time-ordered Beats) + learn->Beat & mirror-commit->Beat hooks + tests  (source: git:d5a1d58452b9)
- Next Slice 2: TrackRouter heuristic to route Beats to domain Tracks. Beats currently unrouted (track=None)  [relates: member_of]  (source: learn:experiment:narrative_slice_1_beatlog)
- Slice 8: narrative evaluation harness + gold themes/QA + multi-label metric  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:ab21b4551f94)
- Review fixes: wire ThemeAssigner, make coverage/faithfulness real, harden Slice 7  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:15b3658feccb)
- Narrative Slices 3-7: Chronicler, story CLI, themes, boot feed, test isolation  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:df771d1f80ed)
- Slice 0: narrative schema (Beat/Chapter/Track/Theme/Atlas/Edge) + edge validation vs real 66-type vocab + lexicon; fix fake relationship names in design  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:dea5829af72e)
- Fix stale bootstrap.md: mark Systems 1-5 built, CLI init, current status + stale-doc warning  (source: git:3f8fd8945b04)
- Agent-interface refinements + knowledge backup/restore tooling  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:2aba7a181f51)
- Post-refactor architecture baseline (Store/Ledger + primitives + Context + ACI)  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:10a960c05305)
- Capture perspectives+maps design note (schema-on-read + lenses for agent memory); record research  (source: git:fcf1ee6cbb20)
- Add narrative test & verification plan: per-slice acceptance bars + benchmark metrics + self-tests  (source: git:6b0d501091f7)
- Add closest-analogues research (RAPTOR/GraphRAG/HippoRAG/Amory + Zettelkasten/PARA) + what we uniquely combine  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:6c6489593161)
- Multi-domain narrative: Tracks/Themes + relationship-type edge schema + TrackRouter (context-inferred) + revised slices  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:ccc86487040c)
- Refine narrative-spine plan with our naming/architecture research; resolve the 4 decisions  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:cdf05cff5954)
- Add narrative-spine design plan (System 4 capstone) w/ prior-art lessons  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:83e70b7d7e74)
- Agent-init discovery endpoint + followable source pointers + py auto-detect  (source: git:9a7c41a745d7)
- Add scripts/mirror.py: one-step commit + push helper  [relates: member_of]  (source: git:0abcc62f6881)
- Session ended  (source: bootstrap:end)
- Wired session logging: bootstrap emits session-start, agent_cli log subcommand, story --session-end  (source: session:wireup)
- Session started  (source: bootstrap:start)
